The field of Planetary Geology is likely to grow for the foreseeable future, and Lunar exploration is taking the lead. The Lunar South Pole and other permanently shaded regions (PSRs) have proven ideal for the development and sustainability of a lunar colony. The presence of abundant water ice at the moonâ€™s south Pole could sustain a lunar colony and produce resources for exploring other celestial bodies, including planets. Recent studies use lidar, reflectance spectroscopy, albedo, and temperature to assess the lunar terrain, geology, and potential water resources. 
This research aims to further assess the abundance and distribution of lunar natural resources for the feasibility of a permanent lunar base. This synthesis includes data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbital, Lunar Prospector, and the Moon Mineralogy Mapper. It involves mapping the geologic resources, water ice, and volatiles in the Shackleton crater and surrounding region.    
Results from this work will assist in the planning and design phase for establishing a permanent colony, the gateway station, and the space exploration program.
